The Waist Circumference-Adipose Tissue business Problem:-

-Studies have shown that individuals with excess "Adipose tissue"(AT) in the abdominal region have a higher risk of Cardio-vascular diseases.
-"Computed Tomography",commonly called the CT-scan is the only technique that allows for the precise and reliable measurement of the AT(at any site in the body).
-The problems with using CT-scan are:-
1)Many physicians do not have access to this technology.
2)Irradiation of the patient(supresses the immune system).
3)Expensive.
-Is there a simpler yet reasonably accurate way to predict the AT area?i.e
1)Easily available
2)Risk free
3)Inexpensive
-A group of researchers conducted a study with the aim of predicting abdominal AT area using anthropometric measurements i.e measurements on the human body.
-The Waist Circumference-Adipose Tissue data is a part of this study wherein the aim is to study how well waist circumference(WC) predicts the AT area.
